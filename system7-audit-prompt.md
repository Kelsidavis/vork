# System 7 Codebase: Comprehensive Overnight Audit & Remediation Plan

## Mission Statement
Conduct a complete architectural review of the System 7 reimplementation codebase to achieve 100% API parity with the original Macintosh System 7 operating system. Identify all deficiencies, security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and missing functionality. Produce a detailed, chapter-based remediation plan with concrete action items.

---

## Phase 1: Codebase Discovery & Mapping (30 minutes)

### Task 1.1: Repository Structure Analysis
1. List all source files and directories recursively
2. Identify main entry points (main.rs, lib.rs, etc.)
3. Map module hierarchy and dependencies
4. Create a visual tree of the codebase structure
5. Document build system (Cargo.toml, build scripts)

**Deliverable**: Complete file tree with annotations showing purpose of each module

### Task 1.2: API Surface Inventory
1. Extract all public functions, structs, enums, and traits
2. Categorize by subsystem (Memory Manager, File Manager, QuickDraw, etc.)
3. Cross-reference with original System 7 API documentation
4. Flag APIs that exist in original but missing in reimplementation
5. Flag APIs that exist but have incomplete implementations

**Deliverable**: Comprehensive API coverage matrix (Implemented vs Missing vs Partial)
